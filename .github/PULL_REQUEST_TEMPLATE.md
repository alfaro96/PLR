#### What does this implement?

#### Any other comments?

<!--
Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience
is necessary, and assistance handling other issues is very welcome.
We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we
are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking,
tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply
busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review
process.
