# Contributing to scikit-lr

There are many ways to contribute to scikit-lr, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If
you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not
hesitate to submit a GitHub pull request.

There are many other ways to help. In particular, answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/alfaro96/scikit-lr/issues), investigating
bugs, and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/alfaro96/scikit-lr/pulls)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you are facing, and give a
"thumbs up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you.
It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your
blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in
GitHub to say: "I use it".
